# SSH Commands

The `ssh` command group allows you to manage SSH configurations for your cloud machines. These commands help you set up and manage SSH access to your machines.

## Add Machine to SSH Config

Add a machine to your SSH configuration file for easier access.

```bash
lazycloud ssh add <machine-name>
```

This command will:
1. Get the machine's alias and port from the API
2. Add the machine to your SSH config with the appropriate settings
3. Use your user ID for the SSH connection

### Example

```bash
lazycloud ssh add my-machine
```

## Remove Machine from SSH Config

Remove a machine from your SSH configuration file.

```bash
lazycloud ssh remove <machine-name>
```

This command will remove the machine's entry from your SSH config file.

### Example

```bash
lazycloud ssh remove my-machine
```

## Notes

- Machines are automatically added to your SSH config when created using `lazycloud machines create`
- Machines are automatically removed from your SSH config when destroyed using `lazycloud machines destroy`
- The SSH config is managed in your local SSH configuration file
- All commands require an active API key to be set
- Machine names are case-sensitive
- You can connect to machines using either:
  - `lazycloud machines connect <machine-name>` (recommended)
  - `ssh <machine-name>` (after adding to SSH config)

## Examples

Here's a complete workflow example:

```bash
# Create a new machine (automatically adds to SSH config)
lazycloud machines create my-machine

# Manually add to SSH config if needed
lazycloud ssh add my-machine

# Connect to the machine
lazycloud machines connect my-machine

# Remove from SSH config if needed
lazycloud ssh remove my-machine

# Or destroy the machine (automatically removes from SSH config)
lazycloud machines destroy my-machine
```
