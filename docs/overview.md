# LazyCloud CLI Overview

The LazyCloud CLI (`lazycloud`) is a command-line tool for managing your cloud machines and resources. This guide will help you get started with the CLI.

## Installation

Install the LazyCloud CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install lazycloud
```

## Getting Started

Before using the CLI, you'll need to:

1. Set up your API key:
```bash
lazycloud keys add my-key YOUR_API_KEY
lazycloud keys use my-key
```

2. Ensure you have SSH keys set up for machine access:
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

## Command Structure

The CLI is organized into the following command groups:

- `keys` - Manage API keys
- `machines` - Manage cloud machines
- `volumes` - Manage machine storage volumes

Each command group has its own set of subcommands. For example:

```bash
# List all available commands
lazycloud --help

# Get help for a specific command group
lazycloud machines --help

# Get help for a specific command
lazycloud machines create --help
```

## Common Options

Many commands support these common options:

- `-h, --help` - Show help message
- `--version` - Show version information

## Best Practices

1. Always use an active API key
2. Keep your API keys secure
3. Use descriptive names for your resources
4. Regularly check your resource usage
5. Clean up unused resources
6. Use SSH keys for secure machine access
7. Back up important data before making major changes

## Error Handling

The CLI provides clear error messages when something goes wrong. Common errors include:

- Invalid API key
- Resource not found
- Insufficient permissions
- Invalid configuration
- Network issues

## Examples

Here's a basic workflow to get started:

```bash
# Set up your API key
lazycloud keys add my-key YOUR_API_KEY
lazycloud keys use my-key

# Create a new machine
lazycloud machines create my-machine --cpu 4 --memory 8

# Connect to the machine
lazycloud machines connect my-machine

# When done, clean up
lazycloud machines destroy my-machine
```
