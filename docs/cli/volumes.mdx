# Volumes Commands

The `volumes` command group allows you to manage storage volumes for your cloud machines. Here are all the available commands:

## Extend Volume

Extend the storage volume of a machine to a new size.

```bash
lazycloud volumes extend <machine-name> <size>
```

### Arguments

- `machine-name` - Name of the machine whose volume you want to extend
- `size` - New size of the volume in GB

### Example

```bash
# Extend volume on my-machine to 100GB
lazycloud volumes extend my-machine 100
```

## Notes

- Volume extension is an irreversible operation
- Make sure you have enough quota available before extending volumes
- The machine must be running to extend its volume
- Volume extension may take some time to complete
- All commands require an active API key to be set
- Machine names are case-sensitive
- Volume size must be specified in whole GB units
