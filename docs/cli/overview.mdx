# LazyCloud CLI Overview

The LazyCloud CLI (`lazycloud`) is a command-line tool for managing your cloud machines and resources. This guide will help you get started with the CLI.

## Installation

Install the LazyCloud CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install lazycloud
```

## Getting Started

Before using the CLI, you'll need to:

1. Set up your API key:
```bash
# Add your API key
lazycloud keys add my-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Set it as active
lazycloud keys set-active my-key
```

2. Set up SSH keys for machine access:
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add the SSH key to your account
lazycloud ssh keys add my-ssh-key
```

## Command Structure

The CLI is organized into the following command groups:

- `keys` - Manage API keys
  - `add` - Add a new API key
  - `ls` - List all API keys
  - `get` - Get API key details
  - `set-active` - Set active API key
  - `rm` - Remove an API key

- `machines` - Manage cloud machines
  - `create` - Create a new machine
  - `ls` - List all machines
  - `get` - Get machine details
  - `scale` - Scale machine resources
  - `connect` - Connect to a machine
  - `destroy` - Destroy a machine

- `volumes` - Manage machine storage volumes
  - `extend` - Extend a machine's volume

- `ssh` - Manage SSH keys and configurations
  - `keys` - Manage SSH keys
    - `add` - Add an SSH key
    - `ls` - List SSH keys
    - `rm` - Remove an SSH key
  - `config` - Manage SSH configuration
    - `show` - Show SSH config
    - `clear` - Clear SSH config
  - `add` - Add machine to SSH config
  - `remove` - Remove machine from SSH config

Each command group has its own set of subcommands. For example:

```bash
# List all available commands
lazycloud --help

# Get help for a specific command group
lazycloud machines --help

# Get help for a specific command
lazycloud machines create --help
```

## Common Options

Many commands support these common options:

- `-h, --help` - Show help message
- `--version` - Show version information

## Best Practices

1. Always use an active API key
2. Keep your API keys secure and never share them
3. Use different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
4. Regularly rotate your API keys for security
5. Use descriptive names for your resources
6. Regularly check your resource usage
7. Clean up unused resources
8. Use SSH keys for secure machine access
9. Back up important data before making major changes
10. Validate your API keys before using them in production

## Error Handling

The CLI provides clear error messages when something goes wrong. Common errors include:

- Invalid API key
- Resource not found
- Insufficient permissions
- Invalid configuration
- Network issues
- SSH key validation failures
- Volume extension failures

## Examples

Here's a complete workflow to get started:

```bash
# Set up your API key
lazycloud keys add my-key YOUR_API_KEY
lazycloud keys set-active my-key

# Add your SSH key
lazycloud ssh keys add my-ssh-key

# Create a new machine
lazycloud machines create my-machine --cpu 4 --memory 8 --volume-size 50

# List your machines
lazycloud machines ls

# Connect to the machine
lazycloud machines connect my-machine

# Extend the volume when needed
lazycloud volumes extend my-machine 100

# Scale the machine when needed
lazycloud machines scale my-machine --cpu 8 --memory 16

# When done, clean up
lazycloud machines destroy my-machine
```
